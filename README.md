**qf** is a Ruby gem that extracts specific substrings from a block of text.

**qf** is a productivity tool, it behaves like a standard Unix application and can be chained with other Unix commands.

It helps you extract:

* Emails
* URLs
* Magnet Links
* IPv4 & IPv6 Addressses
* Credit Card Numbers

.. and **much more** from any stream with flexibility and convenience.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'qf'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install qf

## Examples

**qf** behaves like a standard Unix application.

Let's say you want to extract URLs from a website:

```sh
curl kerembozdas.com | qf url
```

Or extract and save credit card numbers from a csv file:

```sh
cat customers.csv | qf creditcard > customer_ccn.txt
```

Emails from some contact page:

```sh
curl linux.com/contact | qf email
```

To see all the options you can use:

## Trivia

**qf** (pronounced as **/kjuÀê eff/**) is short for **quick fetch**, or **quick find**.  
However, similar to how people pronounce **SQL** as **sequel**, the author likes to pronounce **qf** as **queef**.
